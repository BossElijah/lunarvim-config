# LunarVim config
This is my LunarVim configuration file.

If you want to try it out, just replace your own LunarVim config file with this. In order to make the config work, run `:PackerSync`, `:PackerCompile`, and `:PackerInstall` inside LunarVim. Then restart, and you're good to go!

I installed the LunarVim stable version (not the rolling).

I assume you are already a LunarVim user. If not, go to [their website](https://www.lunarvim.org/01-installing.html) and install it. Make sure you install the stable version, and not the rolling version.

It is best if you also have a nerd font installed, and have set the nerd font as the default font in your terminal. I use a font called "JetBrainsMono Nerd Font" that I installed from [nerdfonts.com](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads).

## Troubleshooting
 - If LunarVim complains about emmet-ls not being found, run this command: `:LspInstall emmet_ls`
